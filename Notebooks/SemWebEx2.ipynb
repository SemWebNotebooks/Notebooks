    "# SPARQL\n",
    "SPARQL stands for **S**PARQL **P**rotocol **A**nd **R**DF **Q**uery **L**anguage and is a [W3C recommended](https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-overview/) language for querying and manipulating RDF graph content. As its syntax is similar Turtle, we will first look at an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "**PREFIX ex: http://example.org/#<br>   \n",
    "SELECT ?countryName ?capitalName  \n",
    "WHERE {  \n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ex:Germany ex:name ?countryName .  \n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ex:Germany ex:capital ?capital .  \n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;?capital ex:name ?capitalName  \n",
    "}**\n",
    "\n",
    "The following information was extracted from the [W3C SPARQL Query Language Specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/2013/REC-sparql11-query-20130321/). If you have any questions regarding SPARQL please first consult this document.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prefixes\n",
    "As in Turtle, we can define *prefixes* to make our query more human-readable. In SPARQL, prefix declarations start with the keyword **PREFIX** and are then followed by the desired abbreviation and then the IRI to abbreviate. This syntax also works in turtle but note that there is *no period* at the end of the line (in contrary to the *@prefix* syntax which only works in Turtle). In the example above, we abbreviate the URI http://example.org/# to *ex:*.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Queries\n",
    "After all our prefix declarations, the query starts. First we need to specify a *query type*. SPARQL defines four query types which all match a given graph pattern against an RDF graph but differ in what they return:\n",
    "- **SELECT:** Queries return the variable bindings of user-specified variables which satisfy the given graph pattern.\n",
    "- **ASK:** Queries return a boolean result based on whether the given graph pattern could be matched against the RDF graph or not.\n",
    "- **CONSTRUCT:** Queries return a new graph which is constructed from a template and the variable bindings which satisfy the given graph pattern.\n",
    "- **DESCRIBE:** Queries return an RDF graph which describes the resource based on what the query service deems important (different query services can yield different results for the same graph).\n",
    "\n",
    "In our example above, we use a SELECT query. The graph pattern follows after the keyword **WHERE** and is surrounded by braces ({}).\n",
    "## Basic Graph Patterns\n",
    "We use so-called **Graph Patterns** to query an RDF graph. *Basic Graph Patterns* look very similar to Turtle as they use the same triple syntax. The only difference is that in Graph Patterns, we can also use variables at every position where an IRI can be used. Variables always start with a question mark and need an identifier. The graph pattern in our example (after the WHERE keyword) features three variables - namely ?countryName, ?capital and ?capitalName - in three triples. When matching a Graph Pattern against an RDF graph, the query service searches for variables bindings such that the Graph Pattern matches a part of the queried graph. When a variable occurs more than once in a pattern, both occurences have to be bound to the same value in a match. Also note that the period at the end of a line represents a conjuction (AND), which is why we the last period of a Graph Pattern is optional. There are also more complex Graph Patterns called Group Graph Patterns, which we will cover later on.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Parameters\n",
    "The four query types take different parameters:  \n",
    "- **SELECT:** A set of variables delimited by spaces, on which the variable bindings should be projected. In our example we use the three variables ?capital, ?capitalName and ?countryName but we only want the last two to appear in our results, thus we specify ?capitalName and ?countryName after the SELECT keyword. If you want to project all variables, you can use an asterisk (\\*) at this position.\n",
    "- **ASK:** No parameters except for the graph pattern to match the RDF graph against.\n",
    "- **CONSTRUCT:** A Basic Graph Pattern as a template and a Graph Pattern for matching. The variable bindings resulting from matching the Graph Pattern against the RDF graph are then used to construct a new graph based on the template. When no template is given, the Graph Pattern used for matching is also used as the template but then only Basic Graph Patterns are allowed.\n",
    "- **DESCRIBE:** A set of variables and IRIs delimited by space which should be described by the resulting graph. One can also provide a Graph Pattern to identify resources or give constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "## FROM Statement\n",
    "One can also use a FROM or a FROM NAMED statement to specify a dataset which should be queried. With this multiple graphs can be queried and/or merged. This won't be needed in this exercise but if you're interested you can [read about it](https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-query/#specifyingDataset).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Syntactic Sugar\n",
    "All the syntactic sugar from Turtle can also be used in SPARQL Graph Patterns!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Graph: Simpsons\n",
    "The RDF graph below contains some information about a family called Simpsons.\n",
    "**You must run the following cell or the graph won't be in scope for following tasks.**"

    "## Filters, Functions, Modifiers and Aggregates\n",
    "With Group Graph Patterns and Solution Modifiers we can efficiently query RDF graphs but what if we actually want to do something with the data like calculating an average, filtering specific values or binding our own values? There are many ways to do this and we will introduce the most important ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Filters\n",
    "One can filter values inside a Group Graph Pattern by using the **FILTER** function. Inside the parantheses of the filter function we have to provide a filter expression. A Filter expression uses operators like \\<, =, \\> \\<=, \\>= and != to compare variables and literals with specific datatypes. We can also use arithmetic operators like +, -, \\* and /. We can also combine multiple filter expressions with AND (&&), OR (||) and NOT (!). Filters are always applied to the whole Group Pattern in which they reside. There are also many functions which can be used in filter expressions like **contains** which checks if a string contains another string or **str** which converts a literal to its literal value (without datatype) or **regex** which matches a string with a full regular expression. Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "**SELECT \\* WHERE {  \n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;?employee a c:Employee ;  \n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;?employee rdfs:label ?name ;  \n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;p:income ?income .  \n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;FILTER (str(?name) != \"Angela\" && contains(?name, \"la\") && ?income > 450)  \n",
    "}**\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we show all employees with their name and income who have an income larger than 450, aren't called \"Angela\" and whose name contains \"la\".\n",
    "\n",
    "### Aggregates\n",
    "To calculate values over multiple results, we need to use aggregate functions. The most important aggregate functions are min, max, avg, sum and count. These can simply be used in the projection. Aggregate functions always work on groups of results and compute separately for each group. By default all results are one big group but you can use the **GROUP BY** modifier to specify a variable to group by. For example if you want to know for all employers what the average income of their employees is, you could do it like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "**SELECT ?employer (sum(?income) AS ?incomeSum) WHERE {  \n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;?employer a c:Employer .  \n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;?employee a c:Employee ;  \n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;p:worksFor ?employer ;  \n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;p:income ?income .   \n",
    "}\n",
    "GROUP BY ?employer**\n",
    "\n",
    "Please note that it is obligatory to bind the result with the **AS** keyword and surround the expression with parentheses. You can also use other functions and arithmetic operators on the left side of the AS, for example to remove a 10% tax you could do **(sum(?income)*0.9 AS ?incomeSum)** instead.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Manual Binding\n",
    "One can also bind their own values to variables using the BIND keyword. If you want to get the difference in population of Germany and Sweden:\n",
    "\n",
    "**SELECT ?diff WHERE {  \n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;s:Germany p:population ?x .  \n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;s:Sweden p:population ?y .  \n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BIND (abs(?x - ?y) AS ?diff)  \n",
    "}**\n",
    "\n",
    "Again, you can use all kinds of expressions on the left side of the AS keyword.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Graph: Movies\n",
    "This graph contains information about some of the highest grossing films.  \n",
    "**You must run the following cell or the graph won't be in scope for following tasks.**"
