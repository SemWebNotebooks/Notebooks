    "But this is not all: jupyter notebooks allow for automated grading! After completing the given code snippets, you can upload your notebook file as submission to moodle. We will then autograde your submission using nbGrader. This works by executing unit tests on your code, basically checking if your code does what it should do. If a test fails, you will not get points for that task. After autograding you will get a feedback file that shows you which test failed.\n",
    "\n",
    "To give you a reference, some of the tests will be visible and executable for you. You can use this to check if your code has the correct format. But don't forget that there are also hidden tests, so just because the visible tests work does not mean your code is completely correct.\n",
